# Beautiful Photometry

A set of tools to compute lighting photometric data and generate beautiful graphics.

For example, it can output a color spectrum showing the melanopic sensitivity curve:

![Color Spectrum](/out/daylight.png)

Or it can show a comparison among spectra:

![Spectral Comparison](/out/Traditional%20Source%20Comparison.png)

This is an early work in progress!
